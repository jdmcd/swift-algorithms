# Swift Algorithms
A collection of algorithms written in swift

This repository contains algorithms that are meant to be interesting, written in Swift.

# add-numbers.swift
Function that takes an Int as an input, and adds up every number leading up to the input. For example, an input of 3 would result in 6 (1 + 2 + 3 = 6)

# calculate-name.swift
Function that assigns each letter in the alphabet a number, and then calculates the value of an inputted string based on those values.
